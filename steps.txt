1. Load user-song list from S3 bucket and map it to dataset
2. Drop the nullable field. Add two columns userIdN, songidN with the integer values using String indexer
3. Group the dataset by userId, song ID and compute the frequency. (Frequency will be considered as the ItemId for ALS algorithm)
4. Load the song-artist mapping
5. Join this with other dataset resulting in Dataset with columns UserId, UserIdN,SongId, Frequency, artistId
6. create a Map with key as 
7. Compute the ALS algorithm (rank=5) and formulate the 5 features
8. Convert the ALS provided featurs to Vector densed model
9. Execute the kmeans clustering (k=300) with the dataset holding userId and the 5 features returned by ALS
10.This returned 300 clusters for the user group
11. Identify the popular artist for each cluster (Based on artist to List<user>  mapping)
11. Load the NBotifcation record from S3
12. For each notificaiton, Identify the List of artist from dataset.
13. For each artist -> identify the clusters it is popular. Notificaiton will be pushed to all users in that cliuster
